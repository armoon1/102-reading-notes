BIOS it activated when computer switched on and perform power on self test and determine which device checked for OS. We can change the setting to different components for booting first. Since it shows the malfunction of components in the start up and initiate the booting, it's important to know more about it.

## What is the BIOS?

BIOS is a system utility program which loads the operation system when we turn on the computer.

## Use analogies from your previous background to explain what happens during the booting process?

Who we first switch on the computer BIOS will check the components to see if they are good, then directs the computer to the main OS.

## What is the “Power On Self Test”?

It's a testing process that check the essential components of the computer such as RAM, CPU, storage drives,... to see working correctly.

## What is the CMOS?

CMOS is type of technology that used to produce integrated circuts and used to store critical data used by OS during booting process.

## What is the CMOS battery?

CMOS is a non-volatile RAM and needs battery to retain the stored data when we switch off the computer.
